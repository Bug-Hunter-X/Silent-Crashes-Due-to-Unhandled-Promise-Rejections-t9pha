# Silent Crashes Due to Unhandled Promise Rejections in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications: silent crashes caused by unhandled promise rejections.  The provided code showcases a typical asynchronous operation (fetching data from an API).  Without proper error handling, failures during the fetch process can lead to the application crashing without clear error messages in the console.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application using your preferred React Native method.
4. Observe that while there might not be an immediate crash or visible error, a promise rejection may occur if the API request fails or encounters an error.

## Solution

The solution involves using a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous operation to handle potential errors and providing a suitable fallback mechanism (such as displaying an error message to the user) in the UI.  The `finally` block ensures that cleanup actions (like updating the loading state) are performed regardless of success or failure.

## Additional Notes

- Unhandled promise rejections can be particularly tricky to debug because they may not immediately manifest as crashes, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior.
- Always implement robust error handling in your asynchronous code to gracefully handle potential failures and enhance your app's stability.
- Consider using a global error handler to catch and log unhandled promise rejections in development to facilitate debugging.
